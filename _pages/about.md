I am a first year Master student at the [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)](http://www.iscas.ac.cn). Before that, I got my Bachelor degree at [Wuhan University of Technology](https://www.whut.edu.cn). My research interests lie in reinforcement learning, VLN and explainable AI. I am passionate about developing reliable and efficient agents.
